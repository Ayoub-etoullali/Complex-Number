A program that allows to manipulate complex numbers, which are numbers of the form a + bi, where a and b are real numbers and i is the square root of -1. This program could allow common mathematical operations on complex numbers, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, as well as more advanced functions such as square root or power. It could also include functions to display complex numbers in different forms, such as trigonometric or exponential form. The project could be used for applications in the fields of physics, electronics, cryptography, etc.
